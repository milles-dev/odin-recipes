    <h4><em>Lasagne al Pesto</em> - a nutty twist on an Italian classic</h4>

    <p>It's all about the layers in lasagne (yes, spelled with an "e" — in Italian, lasagna refers to a single sheet of the wide, flat pasta), 
        the beloved baked dish that hails from Emilia-Romagna. We love this recipe for pesto lasagne, which combines simple fresh 
        ingredients to create a complex symphony of flavors</p>

        <li>1 cup graded Pecorino Sardo or Pecorino Romano</li>
        <li>1/2 cup roasted pine nuts for garnish</li>
    </ul>    

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <h4><em>To mix the Pesto Sauce</em></h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large stone mortar, combine the basil, garlic, and salt, and grind with a pestle until paste.</li>
        <li>Add the cheeses, and drizzle in the olive oil, beating it with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Store the pesto in jars, topped with extra virgin olive oil.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4><em>To create the Lasagne</em></h4>

    <ol>
        <li>If making your own pasta, divide the dough into 8 portions.</li>
        <li>Roll each one out through the thinnest setting on a pasta machine and lay the sheets on a lightly floured surface to dry for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut the pasta into 5-inch squares and cover with a damp kitchen towel.</li>
        <li>Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot and add 2 tablespoons salt. Set up an ice bath next to the stovetop.</li>
        <li>Drop the pasta into the boiling water, 6 or 7 pieces at a time (or according to dry pasta package cooking time), and cook until tender, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the ice bath to cool, then drain on kitchen towels, laying the pasta flat.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4><em>To assemble the dish</em></h4> 

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 425ºF. Bring 6 quarts of water to boil, and add 2 tablespoons salt. Set up an ice bath next to the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Boil the haricots verts for 1 minute. Drain (reserving the hot water), and refresh them in the ice bath. Remove the haricots verts, drain well (reserving the ice water), cut them into 1-inch pieces, and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Cut the pasta into 5-inch squares, and drop them into same boiling water as the haricots verts.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta for 1 minute until tender. Remove, and refresh them in the ice bath. Drain the lasagne on towels, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, stir the béchamel, pesto, and grated cheese together until they are well combined.</li>
        <li>Butter 4 gratin dishes, and place one piece of 5-inch pasta on the bottom of each one.</li>
        <li>On top of the pasta, place the following a few haricots verts and 2 tablespoons of the pesto-béchamel-cheese mixture before adding another layer of the pasta.</li>
        <li>Continue with this layering until there are 4 pieces of pasta and 4 layers of haricots verts and pesto. Lay one more piece of pasta on top, followed by a spoonful of pesto mixture.</li>
        <li>Put the 4 dishes in the oven, and bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until they are bubbling and golden brown on top.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, and enjoy!</li>
