# odin-recipes

For this project, I have created a simple HTML website for Italian Recipes. 

In this project, I was able to establish a basic structure for a website with newfound skills. 
This project contains both absolute and relative links, pictures, and a several organized and unorganized lists. 
All of the recipes and images are sourced from either Flickr.com or Etaly.com and do not belong to me. 

This project has strengthened my skills in basic html syntax and structure, as well as finding ways to be creative with my work.
